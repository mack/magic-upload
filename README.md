# üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú® Magic Upload
A BetterDiscord plugin to automagically upload files over 8MB.
<details>
<summary style="cursor: pointer;"><b>How it works</b></summary>
This plugin uses Google Drive in the background. Users must connect their Google account through OAuth 2.0. The plugin is then able to upload files, that exceed the discord limit, to Google Drive and share a download link in a message.
